# arXiv-Searcher (Terminal)

### Description
A terminal based arXiv search program that allows users to easily access arXiv research papers. Different query options allow users to search based on keywords, topics and authors (hopefully more soon). Without needing to leave the terminal or IDE you are using you can access scholarly articles in a variety of fields. 

### Arguments
- Key Queries
    - `--topic` allows users to search up with keywords in the title or abstract
    - `--author` allows users to search specific authors
    - `--subject` allows users to search specific categories within arXiv.org

- Additional Queries
    - `--action` allows users the choice of either downloading or simply opening a paper, defaults to open
    - `--limit` allows users to change the amount of papers displayed per page on the navigation screen, defaults to 5
    - `--filename` allows the user to specify the filename of the downloaded paper will be saved as in the papers folder
    - `--nav_papers` allows users to view the list of papers downloaded for quick access
        - `<number>` choosing a specific number associated to the paper will allow users to open it in their browser
        - `del <number>` remove specific pdf files from the papers directory of the associated number (ranges and lists of values are able to be deleted as well)
        - `rn <number>` rename specific pdf files from the papers directory of the associated number
        - `q` quit the navigation

- Navigating Queries

### Examples

Example `--topic` query:
```
python .\arXiv_searcher.py --topic "Quantum Computing" 
```
Output:

If the users desired paper is found on this page, input the number associated to the paper. If not, we can navigate the pages with `+` and `-`. Likewise, we can do the same thing with the other two query types (`--author` and `--subject`) and include the additional query types.

Example `--author` with `--limit`:
```
python .\arXiv_searcher.py --author "Sabine Hossenfelder" --limit 10
```
Output:
